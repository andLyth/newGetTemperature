# newGetTemperature
updated version of the getTemperature repository. 

Challenge for position as SW-developer. The challenge consists of reading values from a thermometer connected to an ADC, converting them to temperature values, parsing them to JSON format, and sending them to a HTTP REST endpoint.

UPDATE:
As I was not able to make restclient.cpp work for me in the original getTemperature project, I decided to try to improvestreamline the periodic functioncalls. I also tried to remain true to OOP guidelines, and write more
